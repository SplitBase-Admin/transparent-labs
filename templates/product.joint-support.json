        "overview": "<p>Have you ever taken a joint supplement for months with little-to-no improvement? It wouldn’t surprise us if that’s the case since most of the joint support formulas on the market provide little more than glucosamine and chondroitin, both of which remain largely unproven in clinical trials.</p><p> </p><p>We’ve taken the initiative to create one of the industry’s most comprehensive joint supplements, made exclusively with five of the best clinically-studied ingredients for promoting healthy joint integrity, easing inflammation, and fighting oxidative stress. This innovative joint support formula packs evidence-based doses of patented Curcumin C3 Complex®, FruiteX-B®, Boswellin® Super, UC-II® Collagen, and Bioperine®.<br/> </p><p>By utilizing these standardized and stringently tested ingredients, Transparent Labs Joint Support can help protect, rebuild, and revitalize joints so you can get back to the exercises/activities you love.</p>",
