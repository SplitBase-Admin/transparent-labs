        "overview": "<p>The most crucial time for maximizing muscle growth and results is immediately post-workout as this is when muscle tissue is most sensitive to the anabolic effects of resistance training. Of course, a protein-rich meal or shake is essential after a tough workout, but for optimizing recovery and muscle repair, the body needs targeted “recharging” nutrients that are backed by scientific research and clinical studies. This is precisely why we formulated Transparent Labs Post-Workout with clinical doses of science-based ingredients, including Betapure™, Vitacherry®, Astragin™, Beta-Alanine, L-Glutamine, and L-Carnitine L-Tartrate.</p><p> </p><p>These ingredients work synergistically to bolster nitric oxide (NO) production, reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), facilitate muscle protein synthesis, enhance insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue, and augment gut health so your body is primed for recovery and muscle growth.</p>",
