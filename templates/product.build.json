        "overview": "<p>We formulated Transparent Labs Muscle Builder with three scientifically backed ingredients in clinical doses: PeakO2™, ElevATP®, and HICA (hydroxy-isocaproic acid). These three ingredients have been shown in multiple human studies to increase muscle hypertrophy, ATP production, blood flow, oxygen uptake, and endurance in as little as one week.</p><p> </p><p>By promoting greater muscle anabolism, improving recovery from exercise, and enhancing skeletal muscle metabolism, PeakO2™ and ElevATP® create a revolutionary synergy that can help athletes, gym-goers, and bodybuilders achieve peak performance, day in and day out. HICA, a metabolite of L-leucine, rounds out this muscle-building formula due to its anabolic and anti-catabolic effects in skeletal muscle.</p><p> </p><p>Best of all, Transparent Labs Muscle Builder is naturally flavored, sweetened with stevia, and contains absolutely no artificial food coloring, fillers, GMOs, or allergens.</p>",
